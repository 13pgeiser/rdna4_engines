/* gen_config.h -- the sampling a checkpoint states for itself (generation_config.json), read in
 * its three forms: a file named on the command line, a sidecar beside the container, and the
 * `generation.*` metadata rad-convert flattened into the container.
 *
 * These values set what a request sending no sampler fields gets. Without them SamplingParams'
 * defaults sample the whole vocabulary at temperature 1, and a model tuned with a truncated tail
 * occasionally draws end-of-turn early: replies stop short, and agent turns arrive with text and
 * no tool call. A separate component so this can be tested.
 *
 * Nothing here refuses: values come with the model, so an out-of-range field is warned about and
 * dropped. Command-line overrides are checked in core/config.cpp.
