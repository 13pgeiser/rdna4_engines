/* host_ref.h -- the host reference sampling chain.
 *
 * Sampling runs on device (spec §13) through the declared sampler ops, whose oracle is libref
 * (spec §17). This is a second, independent formulation of the same chain: llama.cpp's samplers
 * ported to plain C++ over a float array, with no llama.cpp or ggml dependency, following
 * `src/llama-sampler.cpp` at upstream commit 06938ac12 (MIT). sample_test holds the sampler
 * driver's chain (Sampler over libref) to it row by row, and Sampler::logprobs_for uses host_dry to
 * undo DRY.
 *
 * Where upstream and the op chain differ, this follows the chain, which is the contract:
 *
 * 1. Chain order. llama.cpp's default is penalties, DRY, top-n-sigma, top-k, typical, top-p,
 *    min-p, XTC, temperature last. Radiance follows the spec and vLLM (see ChainOrder::Radiance).
 *    Top-p, min-p and typical cut on probabilities, so running temperature first changes which
 *    tokens survive. ChainOrder::LlamaCpp keeps upstream's order for checking this port against
 *    llama.cpp itself.
 *
 * 2. RNG. Upstream keeps a stateful std::mt19937 per sampler, which a kernel cannot hold per
 *    sequence and which makes results depend on batch composition. Here randomness is a pure
 *    function of (seed, position, stream): abi/rad_sample.h's draw, bit for bit, with the same
 *    per-stream keys, so the host sees exactly the uniforms the device stages see.
 *
 * 3. Values. top_p, typical_p or xtc_threshold at or below 0 turns the stage off; typical keeps
 *    every candidate tied at its cut; a negative DRY window is the whole context; and top_k 0 is
 *    the candidate width (HostRefInput::max_candidates), not the whole vocabulary.
