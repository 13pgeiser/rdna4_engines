/* tokenizer_regex.h -- the pre-tokeniser pattern compiler.
 *
 * A tokenizer.json `Split` carries a regex in Oniguruma's Ruby syntax, and HuggingFace tokenizers
 * runs it through Oniguruma's backtracking matcher. This compiles the same pattern into a DFA over
 * codepoint classes that reports the same matches:
 *
 *   - Unicode properties are Oniguruma's own (tokenizer_ucd.h), so `\p{L}`, `\s`, `\w` and the
 *     `(?i)` orbits mean what they mean there.
 *   - Alternation is leftmost-first, not leftmost-longest: the DFA carries its NFA threads in
 *     priority order and a match cuts every lower thread, giving backtracking order without
 *     backtracking (the RE2 / regex-automata construction). Lazy quantifiers reverse the priority.
 *   - One-codepoint lookaround (`\s+(?!\S)`, `(?=[\p{L}])`, `(?<=x)`), `^`, `$`, `\A`, `\z`, `\b`
 *     and `\B` are assertions on the neighbouring codepoints. The state carries what it needs of
 *     the previous codepoint, and a lookahead is decided on the transition that reads the next
 *     one, so a match is reported one transition late.
 *   - find_iter follows Oniguruma's iteration, empty matches included: each match is the leftmost
 *     one, and an empty match at the end of the previous match is skipped by one codepoint, as
 *     the `onig` crate does.
 *
 * Anything else is refused at compile time with the construct named: backreferences, atomic
 * groups and possessive quantifiers, lookaround wider than one codepoint, unbounded repetition of
 * something that can match empty, `(?i)` over a character that folds to several (U+00DF vs "ss"),
 * and properties the tables do not carry. There is no fallback matcher; a pattern that does not
 * compile fails the vocabulary load.
