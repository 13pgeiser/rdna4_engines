/* arena.h -- one contiguous allocation, sized by the buffer plan at load and never allocated from
 * at runtime.
 *
 * There is deliberately no allocate(): an allocator on the step path is the dynamic behaviour this
 * engine exists to remove (spec §3.1). Offsets come from the buffer plan, which computes liveness
 * over the declared op list for the worst step; the arena only owns the block they index into.
 *
 * Scratch sits at the tail and is shared by every op on a stream, which is safe because launches
 * on one stream execute in order. A context's second lane is a second stream, so a program that
 * declares one gets a second region per lane (Program::scratch_regions). A lane used without that
 * declaration shares region 0, and Ctx::issue orders a scratch user behind an unordered one on the
 * other lane. Program::scratch_bytes is the largest single kernel's requirement; a kernel asking
 * for more is refused by name in prepare.
