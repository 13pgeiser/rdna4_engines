/* audio.h -- audio generation: the request and the channel its audio comes back on.
 *
 * An audio generator (abi/rad_builder.h, rad_declare_audio_generator) makes a piece in two stages,
 * a language model writing it frame by frame and a denoiser turning runs of frames (windows) into
 * audio, which a vocoder plays. core/gen/audio_driver.h turns a request into those passes; this is
 * what a caller hands it and what it hands back: a window's samples as each is vocoded, then the
 * end.
