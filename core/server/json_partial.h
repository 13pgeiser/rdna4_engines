/* core/server/json_partial.h -- scanning JSON text that is still arriving.
 *
 *   json_complete       Is this a tool call? A call is reported as `finish_reason:
 *                       "tool_calls"` only if its arguments parse whole; a malformed call is
 *                       returned as ordinary content, so a tool is never called with truncated
 *                       arguments.
 *   json_stable_prefix  How much may be streamed now? A fragment is JSON-encoded into the SSE
 *                       payload, so it must end on a UTF-8 boundary; a split code point corrupts
 *                       this delta and the next.
 *   json_quote_append   Writes a string literal exactly as nlohmann does, for delta chunks.
 *
 * A scanner, not a parser: it allocates nothing and builds no DOM.
