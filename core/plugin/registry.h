/* registry.h -- the plugin layer: dlopen, the configured hierarchy, the op-schema registry, the
 * constraint selector, bucket tables and the selection table. spec.md §2 and §16.
 *
 * Rules enforced here and nowhere else:
 *
 *   The hierarchy is absolute. Plugins are queried in configured order and the first plugin with
 *   any matching kernel supplies it; a lower-ranked plugin never outbids a higher one, however
 *   specialised its kernel. That is what makes a user override an override (§2.1).
 *
 *   Specificity is declared, not derived. Within one plugin the highest `priority` among matching
 *   rows wins, ties by declaration order. Counting matched constraints gets it backwards:
 *   {head_dim<=1024, gqa>=1, block%16==0, causal in {0,1}} matches four, {head_dim==256, gqa==6}
 *   matches two, and the second is more specialised.
 *
 *   Schemas are fixed by first declaration. The first plugin in hierarchy order to declare an op
 *   fixes its schema; a later plugin declaring it differently is refused at load with both named.
 *   Arguments are positional, so disagreeing schemas would give the same call different meanings
 *   depending on which plugin won selection (§2.3).
 *
 *   Bucket boundaries are the constraint values: the union of the LE, GE and EQ values candidate
 *   kernels place on the ranged parameter, clamped to the declared range (§2.2).
 *
 *   A reference library is last. A library that declares itself one (RadPluginReferenceFn)
 *   matches every op it declares, so anything ranked behind it would be unreachable. An unnamed
 *   plugin sorts after every named one but ahead of a reference, so a kernel library for a new
 *   card works with no configuration (§18); naming it in the hierarchy overrides that. The rule
 *   is keyed on the declaration, never on a name, so bundled libraries load like third-party ones.
 *
 * Lifetime: a Resolved, a Band and a KernelRow point into a plugin's static tables and are valid
 * only as long as the Registry that loaded them; close() dlcloses. The core keeps one Registry for
 * the process; a tool that loads two kernel sets in turn must finish with the first.
 *
 * Threading: loading is single-threaded, before the rank threads exist. select() and
 * init_instance() run on every rank thread during declare, so the selection log and instance list
 * share one mutex. It is never taken on the step path.
