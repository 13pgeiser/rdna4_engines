/* lora/slots.h -- which adapter each runtime-LoRA slot holds, who is using it, and when a slot may
 * be written again. Host bookkeeping only: the engine copies the adapter's bytes (engine_lora.cpp)
 * and this table decides which slot, publishes the name, hands out holds and frees slots.
 *
 * A SLOT'S LIFE:
 *
 *   free --load--> loaded --unload, no request uses it--> free (cooling)
 *                    |                                         ^
 *                    +--unload, requests use it--> draining ---+ the last of them finishes
 *
 * A request holds the adapter it names from admission until its reply is done (the server keeps
 * the hold in the request's Generation), so an adapter is never unloaded under a request. An
 * unload of an adapter in use DRAINS it: from that moment no new request can name it (it is gone
 * from the names, and acquire answers as for a name never loaded), the requests already holding
 * it finish normally, and the last hold to go frees the slot. A load of the same name waits for
 * that rather than racing it.
 *
 * COOLING: a freed slot is written again only once the step loop has gone round three times
 * since (`epoch` below counts its rounds): the step after a request's last one may already be on
 * the card, issued ahead, and reads the slot through the step batch until it runs.
 *
 * Thread-safe: every call takes the table's lock. Loads are serialised by the caller (one at a
 * time between reserve and publish), which is what keeps a reserved slot from being handed out
 * twice. */
