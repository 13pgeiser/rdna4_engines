/* avx_ngram.cpp -- the row source for embed_lookup_q, and the table's stored layout.
 * Baseline-compiled (no -m flags), like avx_dispatch.cpp; the vector decode comes from the calling
 * level (avx_rows.h).
 *
 * Why a host kernel. The n-gram embedding is 320,001,536 rows of 160 E4M3 bytes (51.2 GB), read 16
 * rows per token. The engine's mechanisms for oversized weights do not fit that access pattern:
 * Tier::SSD + DeviceStaged stages whole movement units, Site::DeviceZeroCopy needs pinned host RAM,
 * and hipHostRegister on the mapping would pin all 51.2 GB. core/format/radfile.cpp mmaps the
 * container, so the table already sits at a host address backed by an NVMe file. The gather runs
 * on the host over that mapping and only the [T, n_embd] bf16 result crosses the link. The placement
 * planner puts an op on the host when all its weight operands are Site::Host (core/runtime/ctx.cpp),
 * so the table must be a weight operand (a plain `gather_rows` input would not trigger it), and a
 * production host kernel is needed since libref is not served (rad_gate_reference_kernels).
 *
 * Row cache plus direct reads. Decoding a row takes a few dozen cycles; fetching it is the cost,
 * and at decode about half the rows a step wants have never been read before. The page cache is
 * the wrong cache: a buffered miss costs the submitting thread ~4 us (page allocation, insertion,
 * block mapping, bio), serialising a call's cold rows, and it keeps a 4 KiB page per 160-byte row
 * (pages average ~1 useful row out of 25). So RowCache (below) holds rows, shared by every gathering
 * thread, and a miss is an O_DIRECT read of the aligned span holding the row (~2 us to submit,
 * 512 bytes instead of 4096). With eight varied sequences a 2^19-row cache (80 MiB) misses 51.0% of
 * rows against 50.6% for an unbounded one.
 *
 * Each miss is read once. Every rank gathers every row. A thread claims a missing row by marking
 * its slot LOADING, reads it and publishes it READY; others wait instead of re-reading. Ranks start
 * at different rows of a call, so the misses are split between them with no barrier.
 *
 * The file is found from the mapping: the ABI passes a pointer, so /proc/self/maps gives the file
 * and offset, once per table. A table not backed by a file (a test's heap buffer) is read as
 * memory. A file on a filesystem without direct I/O is refused; direct_granule finds the read
 * alignment, also where the filesystem reports none. */

/* ============================== the reader that runs a step ahead ==============================
 *
 * A prefill chunk gathers `heads` rows per token (32,768 for a 2048-token chunk); on unseen text
 * most are file reads (~30 ms per chunk on NVMe), during which the issuing thread waits and the card
 * idles. The next chunks' ids are known a step early (RadBatch::n_ahead, ngram_ids' `ahead_ids`), so
 * the call hands them to one process-wide reader thread, which claims, reads and publishes the
 * missing rows while the chunk runs. The next call waits for LOADING rows as it would for the other
 * rank's.
 *
 * The queue is handed over sliced: each job carries at most `kJobRows` keys, claimed and published
 * one job at a time, in order. Claims are promises the consumer waits on (a slot LOADING for a row
 * it needs blocks the gather on the reader's progress), so a job must stay small: bounded claims
 * keep the promise horizon near, and a consumer that outruns the reader finds unclaimed rows it
 * can read itself instead of waiting behind the whole queue. Jobs keep the list's order, so the
 * nearest chunk's rows are always the reader's first work.
 *
 * Both ranks hand over the same ids; a repeated list is dropped. A failed read releases its claims
 * and the next call reads those rows itself. The reader is detached and never destroyed. */
